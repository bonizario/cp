This repository is a small collection of my solutions to some coding problems.

I'm passionate about programming. I've participated in many coding contests (on-site and remote).

In 2023, my team achieved 1st place in the ICPC South America/Brazil First Phase in Uberaba - MG, qualifying for the South America/Brazil Finals in ChapecÃ³ - SC.

I've been studying using
1. LeetCode
2. HackerRank
3. Codeforces
4. Beecrowd
5. ICP's past problems
